I built this for UMD KSA's annual K-Expo, showcasing a variety of talents and performances from within the community. They decided to change up the event and allow users to vote on their favorite performances and ultimately using that to decide winners who were awarded prizes.

This app was originally used but ultimately had a fair amount of problems. Currently in the process of being rebuilt from the ground up.
