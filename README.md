# Voting Application for KSA K-Expo

A live voting app for KSA's K-Expo event. It allows audience members to vote for their favorite performances and ultimately determines the winner. Originally done as a single React + Node app, there were so many problems with the original app that I chose to scrap it and rewrite it entirely so it can be reused year after year. 

The API is written with Node.js backed by a PostgreSQL database and the web application is a React.js app sitting on a simple Node server.
