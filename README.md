I built this for UMD KSA's annual K-Expo, showcasing a variety of talents and performances from within the community. They decided to change up the event and allow users to vote on their favorite performances, ultimately using the audience's vote to decide on the winner.

This app was originally used but had a fair amount of problems. Currently in the process of being rebuilt from the ground up.
